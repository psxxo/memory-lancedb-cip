# OpenClaw Integration Playbook

This guide turns the integration and test findings for `memory-lancedb-pro` into a reusable checklist for two audiences:

- OpenClaw users who want a stable first deployment
- Maintainers who need a practical regression guide for future iterations

It is intentionally generic. It focuses on verifiable behavior, failure signatures, and operating rules instead of local machine paths.

## 0. Start with the correct user path

Before following the rest of this guide, classify your current state:

- new OpenClaw user or first-time memory setup
- existing OpenClaw user adding this plugin later
- existing `memory-lancedb-pro` user upgrading from a pre-v1.1.0 release

The operating rule is:

- `upgrade` is for older `memory-lancedb-pro` data
- `migrate` is for built-in `memory-lancedb` data
- `reembed` is for embedding rebuilds, not routine upgrades

If you mix those paths, debugging becomes much harder because storage-format issues and retrieval-quality issues get conflated.

## 1. Recommended Deployment Modes

Choose one of these modes explicitly.

### Mode A: Retrieval-first memory

Use this when you want:

- `memory_store` / `memory_recall`
- hybrid search (`vector + BM25`)
- auto-capture / auto-recall
- smart extraction and lifecycle ranking

Keep plugin session summaries disabled unless you have a concrete retrieval need for prior sessions.

### Mode B: Retrieval + session-summary search

Use this when you also want `/new` to write a searchable session summary into LanceDB.

In this mode:

- set plugin `sessionStrategy: "memoryReflection"` for LLM-powered reflection (structured extraction, dedup, lifecycle scoring)
- decide whether OpenClaw built-in `session-memory` should also remain enabled

> **Note:** The legacy `sessionMemory.enabled = true` maps to `systemSessionMemory` (simple session summary stored directly in LanceDB), not `memoryReflection`. If you need the full reflection pipeline, use `sessionStrategy` explicitly.

If both are enabled, `/new` can produce two outputs:

- built-in workspace/session summary files
- LanceDB session-summary memories written by `memory-lancedb-pro`

That is valid, but it is a double-write design. If you do not want duplicated session summarization paths, keep only one.

### Mode C: Retrieval + OpenClaw memory runtime and dreaming

Use this when `memory-lancedb-pro` owns `plugins.slots.memory` and OpenClaw should treat the plugin as the active memory capability.

In this mode:

- the plugin registers `runtime`, `promptBuilder`, `flushPlanResolver`, and `publicArtifacts` through `api.registerMemoryCapability`
- `canonicalCorpus.enabled` indexes `MEMORY.md`, `memory/**/*.md`, recent session JSONL transcripts, and `memory/dreaming/**/*.md` into LanceDB
- the files remain the source of truth; LanceDB is the semantic index for grounded search
- runtime search results must include `path`, `startLine`, `endLine`, `snippet`, `source`, and `citation`
- dream reports are exposed as `dream-report` public artifacts, and `memory/.dreams/events.jsonl` is exposed as the dreaming event log

If `dreaming.enabled` is true, OpenClaw may load the built-in memory-core dreaming sidecar while keeping `memory-lancedb-pro` as the selected memory slot owner. Keep the dreaming config under the `memory-lancedb-pro` plugin entry so OpenClaw resolves the sidecar against the active memory plugin.

## 2. Recommended Session Memory Strategy

For most users, use one of these patterns.

### Option 1: Disabled (no plugin session hooks)

Choose this when you mainly want transcript persistence and workspace summaries without plugin involvement.

- plugin `sessionStrategy: "none"` (or omit `sessionStrategy` entirely)
- OpenClaw built-in `hooks.internal.entries.session-memory.enabled = true`

### Option 2: Plugin only (LLM reflection)

Choose this when you want session summaries to participate in LanceDB retrieval with LLM-powered structured extraction, dedup, and lifecycle scoring.

- plugin `sessionStrategy: "memoryReflection"`
- OpenClaw built-in `hooks.internal.entries.session-memory.enabled = false`

### Option 3: Plugin only (simple summary)

Choose this when you want session summaries stored in LanceDB but do not need the full LLM reflection pipeline.

- plugin `sessionStrategy: "systemSessionMemory"`
- OpenClaw built-in `hooks.internal.entries.session-memory.enabled = false`

This writes a plain session summary directly into LanceDB as `fact` / `peripheral` tier entries, without LLM-driven dedup or lifecycle scoring.

### Option 4: Dual write

Choose this only if you explicitly want both:

- workspace markdown/session artifacts (via built-in session-memory)
- LanceDB-searchable session memories (via plugin `sessionStrategy`)

If you use dual write, document it for your team. Otherwise it will look like duplicate behavior during debugging.

### Strategy comparison

| Configuration | Strategy | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `sessionStrategy: "memoryReflection"` | memoryReflection | LLM-powered reflection: structured extraction, dedup, lifecycle scoring |
| `sessionStrategy: "systemSessionMemory"` | systemSessionMemory | Simple session summary stored directly in LanceDB as fact/peripheral |
| `sessionMemory: { enabled: true }` | systemSessionMemory | Legacy shorthand, same as `systemSessionMemory` above |
| `sessionStrategy: "none"` or omitted | none | Plugin session hooks disabled |

## 3. Baseline Verification Checklist

Run this before debugging retrieval quality.

```bash
openclaw config validate
openclaw status
openclaw gateway status
openclaw plugins info memory-lancedb-pro
openclaw hooks list --json
```

Confirm:

- plugin is loaded from the expected path
- `plugins.slots.memory` points to `memory-lancedb-pro`
- the plugin registers a memory capability, not only legacy hooks/tools
- the expected hooks are enabled
- the gateway has been restarted after config changes
- for multi-agent or multi-process write tests, the deployment matches the
  [lock-management requirements](lock-management.md)

If you use plugin session memory, `openclaw hooks list --json` should show the plugin hook:

- `memory-lancedb-pro-session-memory`

If you want plugin-only session summaries, also confirm:

- built-in `session-memory` is disabled

## 4. Fresh-Agent Bootstrap Checks

When a newly created agent fails on its first real turn, do not start with retrieval debugging. Verify agent bootstrap first.

Typical symptom:

- `Unknown model: openai-codex/gpt-5.4`

Common root cause:

- the new agent has not been initialized with agent-local model/auth indexes

Verify these files exist under the new agent directory:

- `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/models.json`
- `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`

Also verify the agent can resolve at least one usable model before testing memory behavior.

Practical rule:

- if a fresh agent cannot complete a plain text turn, memory tests on that agent are not meaningful yet

## 5. Retrieval Quality Rules

### Short CJK keyword queries need explicit validation

Short Chinese keywords are a common false-negative case in hybrid retrieval systems.

Observed pattern during testing:

- unique identifiers or full sentences recall well
- short CJK keywords may depend on BM25/lexical matching quality
- lowering `minScore` can improve recall but often increases noise

Recommended tuning order:

1. verify BM25 / lexical fallback behavior first
2. verify hybrid fusion behavior second
3. tune `minScore` / `hardMinScore` last

Do not start by aggressively lowering thresholds. That often converts a retrieval-quality problem into a relevance-noise problem.

### Lifecycle scoring must not suppress strong fresh hits

If you use lifecycle decay and tiering:

- apply relevance filtering before lifecycle/time decay demotion
- ensure new `working` memories are not pushed below `hardMinScore` simply because decay was applied too early

Regression target:

- a fresh, high-relevance working-tier memory must remain retrievable

## 6. Functional Smoke Tests

These tests cover the core closed loop.

### CLI and storage

```bash
openclaw memory-pro stats
openclaw memory-pro list --scope global --limit 5
openclaw memory-pro search "your test keyword" --scope global --limit 5
```

Validate:

- stats returns usable counts
- list returns stored items in the expected scope
- search returns deterministic results for at least one exact identifier and one natural-language query

### Tool loop

Validate at least once:

- `memory_store`
- `memory_recall`
- `memory_update`
- `memory_forget`
- `memory_list`
- `memory_stats`

### OpenClaw memory runtime loop

When `canonicalCorpus.enabled` is true, create a temporary markdown note under `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and verify runtime memory search can return it with:

- `source: "memory"`
- a real workspace-relative path, not only a `memory-lancedb-pro/<id>.md` virtual path
- line numbers and a snippet that match the file

For session transcript coverage, verify a recent `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/*.jsonl` entry can be returned with `source: "sessions"` when session transcript indexing is enabled.

For dreaming coverage, verify that `memory/dreaming/*.md` appears as a `dream-report` public artifact and that `memory/.dreams/events.jsonl` appears as an `event-log` public artifact when present.

### Public X/Twitter source capture

Use this optional recipe when an OpenClaw agent gathers public X/Twitter context through TweetClaw and you want a reviewed source summary to become searchable memory.

Allowed source actions:

- search public tweets or replies
- look up a public user profile
- export public follower or media metadata when the workflow needs it
- consume monitors or webhooks that report public tweet events

Before calling `memory_store`, review the source result and keep only durable research context:

- tweet URL
- author handle
- published timestamp
- short text excerpt or human-written summary
- relevant metrics, if needed for the research task
- query or monitor that found the source
- capture date

Store the reviewed summary as `category: "fact"` for source evidence or `category: "decision"` when the team has made a decision from that evidence. Include the public source URL and capture date in the memory text or metadata so later recall can cite where the information came from.

Never store secrets or private account material from this flow:

- API keys, cookies, bearer tokens, or account credentials
- direct-message content
- draft post or reply text
- non-public profile, follower, or media data

Keep visible X/Twitter actions outside the memory plugin. Posting tweets, posting replies, sending direct messages, uploading media, and downloading media require explicit user approval in the tool workflow that performs the action. `memory-lancedb-pro` should only persist the reviewed summary after that workflow has produced safe public source context.

Verification checklist:

- the stored memory contains the public URL and capture date
- the text is a summary or short excerpt, not a raw transcript dump
- no credentials, cookies, direct messages, or draft text appear in the memory
- any visible action on X/Twitter was approved outside the memory plugin

### Scope isolation

Validate at least:

- `main -> main` hits
- `main -> work` miss
- `work -> global` allowed if intended
- `life -> work` miss unless explicitly permitted

### Smart extraction stability

Validate the three semantic branches:

- `create`
- `merge`
- `skip`

Then run a multi-turn sequence such as:

- `create -> skip -> merge -> skip`

Expected result:

- one stable memory record
- duplicates suppressed
- new facts merged without unbounded duplication

## 7. Real `/new` Session Test

If plugin session memory is enabled, run one real `/new` validation after the basic smoke tests.

Check for three facts:

1. the active session changes
2. the expected hook fires
3. the summary lands in the intended storage path

Plugin evidence should look like:

- a log entry that the session summary was stored for the previous session

If built-in session memory is also enabled, you should additionally see the built-in workspace/session artifact.

If built-in session memory is disabled, do not treat the absence of a workspace session-summary markdown file as a plugin failure.

## 8. Recommended Regression Matrix

Run this matrix before release candidates or after major retrieval changes.

### Integration

- plugin loads successfully
- gateway restart preserves plugin registration
- `hooks list` shows expected hook state

### Retrieval

- exact identifier recall
- short CJK keyword recall
- full sentence semantic recall
- rerank fallback behavior when reranker is unavailable

### Memory lifecycle

- fresh `working` memory remains retrievable
- tier promotion/demotion does not erase useful recall

### Extraction

- `create`
- `merge`
- `skip`
- multi-turn duplicate suppression

### Session flow

- `/new` triggers the intended hook path
- plugin-only mode does not rely on built-in session artifacts
- dual-write mode is explicit and understood

### Canonical corpus and dreaming

- `MEMORY.md` and `memory/**/*.md` stay readable as files
- LanceDB contains indexed corpus entries with `openclaw_corpus` metadata
- session transcript indexing can be disabled independently with `canonicalCorpus.includeSessionTranscripts`
- dreaming config validates under the `memory-lancedb-pro` plugin entry
- public artifacts include dream reports and the dreaming event log when files exist

### Agent bootstrap

- newly added agent can complete its first turn
- new agent has usable model/auth indexes

## 9. Troubleshooting Patterns

### Search returns empty, but the store contains data

Check in this order:

1. scope mismatch
2. `minScore` / `hardMinScore`
3. BM25 / lexical fallback availability
4. rerank endpoint health
5. lifecycle decay ordering

### `/new` appears to do nothing

Check:

- plugin `sessionStrategy` is set to `"memoryReflection"` or `"systemSessionMemory"` (not `"none"`)
- plugin hook is actually registered and named
- gateway has been restarted after the hook/config change
- built-in hook state matches your intended design

### Results became noisy after tuning

Likely cause:

- threshold reduction solved recall at the cost of precision

Preferred fix order:

1. lexical/BM25 improvement
2. hybrid-fusion tuning
3. rerank tuning
4. threshold change

## 10. Upgrade and Maintenance Notes

If you maintain local patches against the OpenClaw installation itself, treat them as temporary operational fixes, not durable plugin behavior.

After any `openclaw update`, re-check:

- fresh-agent bootstrap
- model provider resolution for newly added agents
- hook registration state
- `/new` behavior

If your team depends on local installation patches, keep them in a repeatable patch or automation script outside the plugin repo.

## 11. Recommended Documentation Policy for Future Changes

When changing retrieval or hook behavior, update all three artifacts together:

- user-facing README summary
- this integration playbook
- regression tests that prove the changed behavior

That keeps operational guidance aligned with actual behavior and prevents README drift.
