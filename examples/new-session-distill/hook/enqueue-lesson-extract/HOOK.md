# Enqueue Lesson Extract Hook

Writes a small JSON task file to a queue directory when `/new` is issued.

This is intentionally fast and non-blocking. A separate systemd worker consumes tasks and:
- reads the session JSONL transcript
- runs Map-Reduce extraction with Gemini Flash
- writes high-signal, deduped lessons into LanceDB CIP
- sends a notification (optional)
