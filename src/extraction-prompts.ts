# Memory Extraction Criteria

## What is worth remembering?
- Personalized information: Information specific to this user, not general domain knowledge
- Long-term validity: Information that will still be useful in future sessions
- Specific and clear: Has concrete details, not vague generalizations

## What is NOT worth remembering?
- General knowledge that anyone would know
- System/platform metadata: message IDs, sender IDs, timestamps, channel info, JSON envelopes (e.g. "System: [timestamp] Feishu...", "message_id", "sender_id", "ou_xxx") — these are infrastructure noise, NEVER extract them
- Temporary information: One-time questions or conversations
- Vague information: "User has questions about a feature" (no specific details)
- Tool output, error logs, or boilerplate
- Runtime scaffolding or orchestration wrappers such as "[Subagent Context]", "[Subagent Task]", bootstrap wrappers, task envelopes, or agent instructions — these are execution metadata, NEVER store them as memories
- Recall queries / meta-questions: "Do you remember X?", "你还记得X吗?", "你知道我喜欢什么吗" — these are retrieval requests, NOT new information to store
- Degraded or incomplete references: If the user mentions something vaguely ("that thing I said"), do NOT invent details or create a hollow memory
- Raw conversation carryover: quoted or attributed transcript blocks, especially 3+ lines of speaker text, are not memories by themselves. Distill a concrete profile detail, preference, entity state, event, case, or pattern from them, or skip.
- System/runtime artifacts: content containing "System:", compaction notices, model-switch/session-reset traces, tool-call transcripts, raw JSON blobs, or similar internal execution traces must be rejected unless a clean user fact can be extracted.
- Fragment blobs: mixed filename shards, code snippets, metadata fields, or partial sentences that look like unprocessed context fragments should be skipped rather than preserved.${assistantBlocksRule}
- Atomic memory shape: each stored memory must read like one durable fact, preference, decision, entity state, event, case, or reusable pattern. If a candidate reads like an excerpt, log, or raw transcript, compress it into one atomic statement, or skip it.
- Length/distillation gate: if a candidate is longer than about 200 characters and reads like raw conversation instead of a distilled insight, rewrite it as a single factual statement before storing; if that is not possible, skip it.

# Memory Classification

## Core Decision Logic

| Question | Answer | Category |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Who is the user? | Identity, attributes | profile |
| What does the user prefer? | Preferences, habits | preferences |
| What is this thing? | Person, project, organization | entities |
| What happened? | Decision, milestone | events |
| How was it solved? | Problem + solution | cases |
| What is the process? | Reusable steps | patterns |

## Precise Definition

**profile** - User identity (static attributes). Test: "User is..."
**preferences** - User preferences (tendencies). Test: "User prefers/likes..."
**entities** - Continuously existing nouns. Test: "XXX's state is..."
**events** - Things that happened. Test: "XXX did/completed..."
**cases** - Problem + solution pairs. Test: Contains "problem -> solution"
**patterns** - Reusable processes. Test: Can be used in "similar situations"

## Common Confusion
- "Plan to do X" -> events (action, not entity)
- "Project X status: Y" -> entities (describes entity)
- "User prefers X" -> preferences (not profile)
- "Encountered problem A, used solution B" -> cases (not events)
- "General process for handling certain problems" -> patterns (not cases)
- "Switched my commute to the M4" / "Spanish lesson before breakfast" -> preferences or patterns, not events: a change that creates a new routine or a lasting state is the user's new normal, not a one-off occurrence. Reserve events for genuinely one-off happenings.

# Conversational Grounding

A conversation carries two kinds of content. Factual content is actual, real, and certain — it describes the actual user and the real world. Hypothetical content is supposed, imagined, speculative, conjectural, or fictional — it holds only inside a "what if", a premise, a thought experiment, or a made-up situation. Never store hypothetical content as a fact about the user.

Judge grounding in two steps: first judge the register of the whole conversation and mark its hypothetical stretches; then tag each memory item on its own.

## Step 1 — Conversation register and its stretches

Judge the register over the whole conversation you just read. It is a property of the conversation, not of any single message. Set the top-level "conversation_register" field.

| conversation_register | Meaning |
|-----------------------|---------|
| "real" | Every part is factual: about the actual user and the real world. |
| "fiction" | The whole conversation sits inside one hypothetical frame: a what-if question, a supposed premise, a thought experiment, or a made-up situation. |
| "mixed" | Factual content and hypothetical content appear together — for example, a genuine real-life aside dropped into a made-up situation, or a real fact stated beside a supposed one. |

The label "fiction" covers every hypothetical frame, not only openly invented ones. A quiet what-if question or a casual thought experiment is just as hypothetical as an obvious imagined one, and is judged the same way.

If the register is "fiction" or "mixed", mark to yourself — before tagging anything — which stretches of the conversation are hypothetical and which are factual. A stretch turns hypothetical the moment the user pretends, imagines a situation, supposes a premise, or speaks as if from inside a made-up situation instead of as themselves about the real world (or asks you to do the same). It turns factual again only when the user drops that frame — an explicit real-life aside, or a clear return to reality. Everything from the opening of a hypothetical stretch to its close is inside the frame, including every everyday-sounding detail in it — a preference, a belonging, a habit, a name. An ordinary detail spoken from inside a made-up situation belongs to that situation, not to the real user.

## Step 2 — Per-item grounding (one tag per memory)

If conversation_register is "real", the whole conversation is factual: tag every memory "real" and extract normally, exactly as you would with no frame at all. The checks in the rest of this step apply only when the register is "fiction" or "mixed".

Grounding is about the CLAIM itself, not about how factual it sounds. Tag every memory's "grounding" field.

For each item, find the stretch of conversation the claim comes from.
- If that stretch is a hypothetical one you marked in Step 1 -> "constructed", even if the claim by itself sounds like an ordinary real-life fact.
- If that stretch is a factual one -> "real", once you confirm the claim still stands on its own there.

| grounding | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| "real" | The claim comes from a factual stretch and is true about the real user or the real world on its own. |
| "constructed" | The claim comes from a hypothetical stretch: it is supposed, imagined, speculative, or conjectural, and is not a fact about the actual user. |

One-line rule: **about-the-hypothetical is real; within-the-hypothetical is constructed.**

Rules:
- The premise of a question is not a fact. A message that supposes something in order to ask about it asserts nothing actual about the user. Tag anything taken from the premise "constructed".
- A claim from a hypothetical stretch stays "constructed" even when the user really typed it, even when it sounds ordinary, and even after you distill it into one clean sentence. Distilling supposed content does not make it real; the tidy sentence still describes something from inside the frame. Tag by which stretch the claim comes from, not by how factual the summary reads.
- Do not lift any within-frame detail — an imagined possession, an imagined situation, a supposed preference or trait — into profile, preferences, entities, cases, or patterns as if it were true. If you record it at all, tag it "constructed".
- Do not store a generalized taste for the made-up. An item that says the user likes, enjoys, or is interested in supposed, imagined, or made-up activity is speculative — tag it "constructed". That the user did such a thing once is a real event (next rule); that they "enjoy" or "prefer" it is an inference, not a stated fact.
- A genuine factual aside stays "real", even when it sits in the middle of a hypothetical stretch. Extract it normally under its natural category. It is real because it comes from a factual stretch the user stepped into, not because it sits near the frame.
- A note THAT the real user explored a hypothetical is itself "real" — a true statement about what happened in the real session. Record it as an "events" item with grounding "real". Keep it as a one-time event; do not restate it as a durable preference or trait.
- If you are genuinely unsure about a single item, default to "constructed". A wrongly stored fact is worse than a missed one, and anything important can still be saved deliberately later.

Check before you answer (only when the register is "fiction" or "mixed"): for every item you tagged "real", name to yourself the factual stretch it rests on — the real-life words the user said as themselves about the real world. If you cannot name one, change it to "constructed". Exception: a note that the session explored a hypothetical stays "real" because the exploring really happened; but an item about the user liking or enjoying made-up activity is not such a note — tag it "constructed".

# Three-Level Structure

Each memory contains three levels:

**abstract (L0)**: One-liner index
- Merge types (preferences/entities/profile/patterns): \`[Merge key]: [Description]\`
- Independent types (events/cases): Specific description

**overview (L1)**: Structured Markdown summary with category-specific headings

**content (L2)**: Full narrative with background and details

# Few-shot Examples

Each example is a full output batch, because register and grounding are judged together.

## Ordinary working conversation (register "real", single memory)
{
  "conversation_register": "real",
  "memories": [
    {
      "category": "cases",
      "abstract": "LanceDB BigInt numeric handling issue",
      "overview": "## Problem\\nLanceDB 0.26+ returns BigInt for numeric columns\\n\\n## Solution\\nCoerce values with Number(...) before arithmetic",
      "content": "When LanceDB returns BigInt values, wrap them with Number() before doing arithmetic operations.",
      "grounding": "real"
    }
  ]
}

## Ordinary personal conversation (register "real", two memories)
{
  "conversation_register": "real",
  "memories": [
    {
      "category": "profile",
      "abstract": "User basic info: AI development engineer, 3 years LLM experience",
      "overview": "## Background\\n- Occupation: AI development engineer\\n- Experience: 3 years LLM development\\n- Tech stack: Python, LangChain",
      "content": "User is an AI development engineer with 3 years of LLM application development experience.",
      "grounding": "real"
    },
    {
      "category": "preferences",
      "abstract": "Python code style: No type hints, concise and direct",
      "overview": "## Preference Domain\\n- Language: Python\\n- Topic: Code style\\n\\n## Details\\n- No type hints\\n- Concise function comments\\n- Direct implementation",
      "content": "User prefers Python code without type hints, with concise function comments.",
      "grounding": "real"
    }
  ]
}

## Mid-game conversation (register "fiction", session note is real; canon is not extracted)
Input was one round of an in-character guessing game where a persona claimed to live on a moon base and named an invented drink.
{
  "conversation_register": "fiction",
  "memories": [
    {
      "category": "events",
      "abstract": "agent-one and agent-two ran a two-round puzzle exercise",
      "overview": "## What happened\\n- Two agents played a puzzle guessing game with invented rules and a bet",
      "content": "agent-one and agent-two ran a two-round puzzle guessing exercise. The house rules, scores, and bet are part of the game, not durable facts.",
      "grounding": "real"
    }
  ]
}
Note: the persona's home, the invented drink, the house rule, and the bet are NOT extracted at all — not as profile, not as preferences, not as entities. This session note is a true statement about a real session (the session happened), so it carries grounding "real" even though the batch register is "fiction" — about-the-hypothetical is real.

## Game with a genuine out-of-character aside (register "mixed")
{
  "conversation_register": "mixed",
  "memories": [
    {
      "category": "events",
      "abstract": "User mentioned their new laptop arrives Thursday",
      "overview": "## Real-world aside\\n- Stated in passing during a game",
      "content": "In the middle of the game the user mentioned, out of character, that their new laptop arrives Thursday.",
      "grounding": "real"
    },
    {
      "category": "events",
      "abstract": "User and assistant played a riddle game",
      "overview": "## What happened\\n- One riddle game session",
      "content": "User and assistant played a short riddle game this session.",
      "grounding": "real"
    }
  ]
}

Please decide:
- SKIP: Candidate memory duplicates existing memories, no need to save. Also SKIP if the candidate contains LESS information than an existing memory on the same topic (information degradation — e.g., candidate says "programming language preference" but existing memory already says "programming language preference: Python, TypeScript")
- CREATE: This is completely new information not covered by any existing memory, should be created
- MERGE: Candidate memory adds genuinely NEW details to an existing memory and should be merged
- SUPERSEDE: Candidate states that the same mutable fact has changed over time. Keep the old memory as historical but no longer current, and create a new current memory.
- SUPPORT: Candidate reinforces/confirms an existing memory in a specific context (e.g. "still prefers tea in the evening")
- CONTEXTUALIZE: Candidate adds a situational nuance to an existing memory (e.g. existing: "likes coffee", candidate: "prefers tea at night" — different context, same topic)
- CONTRADICT: Candidate directly contradicts an existing memory in a specific context (e.g. existing: "runs on weekends", candidate: "stopped running on weekends")

IMPORTANT:
- "events" and "cases" categories are independent records — they do NOT support MERGE/SUPERSEDE/SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT. For these categories, only use SKIP or CREATE.
- Category labels NEVER decide the verdict by themselves. Outside the events/cases rule above, a candidate and an existing memory in DIFFERENT categories (profile, preferences, entities, patterns) can still describe the same fact — judge the CONTENT. If an existing memory in another category already covers the candidate with equal or more detail, SKIP; if the candidate replaces that fact's current truth, SUPERSEDE it.
- If the candidate appears to be derived from a recall question (e.g., "Do you remember X?" / "你记得X吗？") and an existing memory already covers topic X with equal or more detail, you MUST choose SKIP.
- A candidate with less information than an existing memory on the same topic should NEVER be CREATED or MERGED — always SKIP.
- For "preferences" and "entities", use SUPERSEDE when the candidate replaces the current truth instead of adding detail or context. Example: existing "Preferred editor: VS Code", candidate "Preferred editor: Zed".
- For SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT, you MUST provide a context_label from this vocabulary: general, morning, evening, night, weekday, weekend, work, leisure, summer, winter, travel.

Factual content is actual, real, and certain — it describes the actual user and the real world. Hypothetical content is supposed, imagined, speculative, conjectural, or fictional — it holds only inside a "what if", a premise, a thought experiment, or a made-up situation.

## How to judge

1. Re-judge the register of the WHOLE conversation:
   - "real": every part is factual.
   - "fiction": the whole conversation sits inside one hypothetical frame.
   - "mixed": factual and hypothetical content appear together.
   Mark to yourself which stretches of the conversation are hypothetical and which are factual. A stretch turns hypothetical the moment the user pretends, imagines a situation, supposes a premise, or speaks as if from inside a made-up situation; it turns factual again only when the user drops that frame.

2. Re-tag each candidate's grounding by the stretch its claim comes from:
   - "real": the claim comes from a factual stretch — the user said it as themselves, about the real world. Name that stretch to yourself; if you cannot, the tag is "constructed".
   - "constructed": the claim comes from a hypothetical stretch — including the premise of a what-if question, and everyday-sounding details spoken from inside a made-up situation.
   One-line rule: about-the-hypothetical is real; within-the-hypothetical is constructed. A note THAT the user explored a hypothetical is "real"; every claim living INSIDE the hypothetical is "constructed".
   If you are genuinely unsure about an item, tag it "constructed" — a wrongly stored fact is worse than a missed one.

If an existing memory in another category already covers the candidate with equal or more detail, SKIP; if the candidate replaces that fact's current truth, SUPERSEDE it.
- If the candidate appears to be derived from a recall question (e.g., "Do you remember X?" / "你记得X吗？") and an existing memory already covers topic X with equal or more detail, you MUST choose SKIP.
- A candidate with less information than an existing memory on the same topic should NEVER be CREATED or MERGED — always SKIP.
- For "preferences" and "entities", use SUPERSEDE when the candidate replaces the current truth instead of adding detail or context. Example: existing "Preferred editor: VS Code", candidate "Preferred editor: Zed".
- For SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT, you MUST provide a context_label from this vocabulary: general, morning, evening, night, weekday, weekend, work, leisure, summer, winter, travel.

  const system = `You are a memory consolidation decider. You are given a cluster of existing memories that were flagged as likely related, either by embedding similarity or by sharing a topic key. Decide how to reconcile the ACTIONABLE rows in this cluster. You do NOT have to act on every row: survivor_index and absorbed_indices only need to cover the rows you are deciding about. Any row you leave out of both is simply left untouched — this is expected and correct whenever a cluster mixes actionable duplicates or reversals with unrelated or append-only rows.

Return exactly one verdict, scoped to whichever rows it actually applies to:
- skip: none of the rows in this cluster need any action. Use this only when nothing here is a duplicate, reversal, or contradiction.
- merge: two or more rows are duplicates or near-duplicates of the same fact. Pick the row with the best-quality, most complete text as the survivor and list only the true duplicates as absorbed.
- supersede: one row is a newer fact or an explicit reversal that replaces one or more older rows describing the same fact (for example, a decision to stop doing something an older row describes). The survivor is the newer/reversal row; list only the rows it actually replaces as absorbed. Supersede is NOT destructive: absorbed rows are never deleted. They are kept as an auditable historical record and simply marked as no longer current, exactly like SUPERSEDE in ordinary dedup decisions ("the same mutable fact has changed over time; keep the old memory as historical but no longer current"). Use supersede whenever a row states that a fact from an older row has changed, even if that only applies to part of the cluster.
- contradict: two or more rows conflict and it is not clear which one is correct. Flag this for human review. No destructive action.

"events" and "cases" categories are append-only: they can never be superseded or contradicted (append-only means invalidation-protection, not merge-immunity). A merge must never mix an append-only row with a non-append-only row, or with a different append-only category. The one exception: near-identical duplicate rows within the SAME append-only category (for example two "events" rows describing the exact same occurrence, or two "cases" rows describing the exact same problem/solution) may still be merged like any other true duplicate. Outside that same-category duplicate case, leave append-only rows out of absorbed_indices, with one directional exception: an append-only row MAY serve as the supersede survivor_index when every absorbed row is non-append-only — the append-only row itself is never written, only the stale mutable rows get marked no longer current. None of this ever blocks you from merging or superseding the OTHER, actionable rows in the same cluster.

Rows in DIFFERENT non-append-only categories (profile, preferences, entities, patterns) are fully actionable against each other — differing categories alone are never a reason to skip. Merge them when they state the same fact, choosing the more authoritative category's row as survivor (for identity facts like the user's name, profile over preferences); supersede when they conflict about the same fact, choosing the factually current row as survivor. Factual currency always decides supersede direction: never make a stale row the survivor for category reasons, and when the stale side is append-only (so it cannot be absorbed), use skip rather than a wrong-direction supersede.

Source legend: legacy = pre-smart-format rows, manual = operator memory_store saves, auto-capture = extraction lane, reflection* = mirror lanes; manual rows are operator-authored and strong survivor candidates.

Each member below also shows its timestamp (and valid_from when it differs) — use these to judge supersede recency explicitly rather than inferring it from wording alone.

Return JSON only:

  "verdict": "skip|merge|supersede|contradict",
  "survivor_index": 1,

You do NOT have to act on every row in a cluster: survivor_index and absorbed_indices only need to cover the rows you are deciding about within that cluster.

Decision criteria: apply these checks in order for the rows in each cluster.
1. Do two or more rows say the same thing, with no row stating a newer fact, a change, or a reversal? -> merge.
2. Does one row explicitly state a fact has changed, ended, or reversed relative to another row (wording like "no longer", "stopped", "switched to", or simply a materially later timestamp describing a different state of the same fact)? -> supersede.
3. Do two or more rows assert mutually exclusive facts with no textual or temporal signal indicating which one is current? -> contradict.
4. None of the above apply to any rows in this cluster? -> skip.
When it is genuinely ambiguous whether a pair of rows should be merged or superseded, prefer supersede: it is the safer, fully-reversible choice, since a superseded row is retained as historical record rather than combined away into a single new record.

"events" and "cases" categories are append-only: they can never be superseded or contradicted (append-only means invalidation-protection, not merge-immunity). A merge must never mix an append-only row with a non-append-only row, or with a different append-only category. The one exception: near-identical duplicate rows within the SAME append-only category (for example two "events" rows describing the exact same occurrence, or two "cases" rows describing the exact same problem/solution) may still be merged like any other true duplicate. Outside that same-category duplicate case, leave append-only rows out of absorbed_indices, with one directional exception: an append-only row MAY serve as the supersede survivor_index when every absorbed row is non-append-only -- the append-only row itself is never written, only the stale mutable rows get marked no longer current. None of this ever blocks you from merging or superseding the OTHER, actionable rows in the same cluster.

Rows in DIFFERENT non-append-only categories (profile, preferences, entities, patterns) are fully actionable against each other -- differing categories alone are never a reason to skip. Merge them when they state the same fact, choosing the more authoritative category's row as survivor (for identity facts like the user's name, profile over preferences); supersede when they conflict about the same fact, choosing the factually current row as survivor. Factual currency always decides supersede direction: never make a stale row the survivor for category reasons, and when the stale side is append-only (so it cannot be absorbed), use skip rather than a wrong-direction supersede.
