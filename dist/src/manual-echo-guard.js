/**
 * Manual-store echo guard (class): when the user dictates a memory,
 * the same sentence reaches BOTH the manual store lane (memory_store /
 * memory_update, always-priority, verbatim) and auto-capture extraction,
 * which mints near-twin candidates the dedup layer cannot reliably collide —
 * the manual row may be seconds old (fresh-row vector visibility) or land in
 * a different category. The guard remembers recent manual texts per agent
 * and drops near-identical extraction candidates BEFORE the admission judge:
 * deterministic, string-only, no LLM calls, no vector search.
 *
 * Matching is deliberately conservative: a candidate is an echo only when
 * it asserts NOTHING beyond, and nothing different from, the recorded
 * manual text: an exact match, the manual text containing the candidate
 * as a whole-token run (never a raw substring: "has a cat" is not inside
 * "has a catalog"), or the candidate carrying exactly the manual text's
 * content tokens in the same order once reporting glue is stripped, with
 * the relation-bearing words (copulas, prepositions, conjunctions) agreeing
 * too, since "is" against "was", "with" against "for" and "or" against
 * "and" are different assertions. A candidate
 * carrying extra content — a negation ("no longer"), a changed value, a
 * temporal qualifier ("until friday"), or additional facts — is new
 * information and always survives, and so is one that swaps or drops a
 * semantic predicate ("wants" against "has", "prefers Python" against
 * "prefers Go over Python"). The worst case of the guard staying quiet is
 * the pre-guard status quo (one duplicate row for dedup); the worst case of
 * it firing wrongly is a silently lost memory, so every ambiguity resolves
 * toward keeping the candidate.
 *
 * Entries are short-lived and consumed: each recorded manual text expires
 * after MANUAL_ECHO_TTL_MS and suppresses at most ONE candidate (the
 * immediate re-extraction of the same turn). A later identical statement is
 * a deliberate user re-assertion, not an echo. A statement that gets
 * replaced (memory_update, supersede) or forgotten is invalidated at once,
 * so a reversal back to it is never mistaken for an echo of a fact the
 * store no longer holds.
 *
 * Scoped per agent (not per session): the store tool and the auto-capture
 * hook derive their session keys differently, but both resolve the same
 * agent id, and an echo of ANY recent manual text of the same agent is a
 * correct drop regardless of session boundaries. TTL + consumption bound
 * staleness; the ring bounds size.
 *
 * The ledger is in-memory and per process: only the gateway that recorded
 * a text can invalidate it. Deletions made from another process (the
 * memory-pro CLI) are not visible here; the TTL bounds that window to
 * MANUAL_ECHO_TTL_MS, after which the stale entry expires on its own.
