/**
 * Regression tests for grounding-aware extraction (Option A, v3 semantics)
 * and the scope-glob extraction-policy knob (Option C).
 *
 * extractCandidates() tags each raw candidate "grounding": "real" | "constructed".
 * v3 grounding is about the truth-grounding of the ASSERTION itself, not which
 * register the conversation happened in: "real" includes an assertion ABOUT a
 * fiction/game session (e.g. that the session happened); "constructed" is a
 * claim true only WITHIN the fiction (game canon, a persona's invented traits).
 * A constructed-tagged candidate is NEVER stored, in any category or register —
 * there is no per-extraction cap. A genuine first-person aside spoken during
 * play is tagged "real" and must survive under its natural category.
 *
 * Fixtures are entirely synthetic (agent-one/agent-two, invented game
 * content) — no real fleet data.
